this is where you create your content for the recyclerView which is just a container that you can scroll through,
the layadapter creates the content through onBindViewHolder, and pass them in the layout you inflated in onCreateViewHolder


you get your content from the Parsed Json data using the class models

the class get called form the MainActivity from the function "updateText"
